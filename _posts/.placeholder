## Context
As a challenge creator of the HackDay CTF since 2022, I created a Forensic challenge for the 2024 HackDay finals.
Each year a new theme is chosen, this year the theme of espionage has been chosen.
This is the official write-up of this challenge.

## Statement
Our chief has recovered a Syndicate file given to him by our secret agent Hawkeye. It contains communications from a Syndicate member who is planning a mass attack.

Our chief is asking you to **decrypt** this information in order to trace his future actions:

* `TGT renewal date` in dd/mm/yyyy format
* `User's machine name` in uppercase (example: SERVER99)
* `Last subkey value` (example: 99zae54e450ef88ee55511900666115441cd)
* `User SID` (example: S-1-5-21-123456789-987456321-10000000000-1000)

## Files

The following two files are given to participants in order to solve the challenge:
* PCAP capture: [analysis_admin.pcapng](/files/HackDay2024/analysis_admin.pcapng)
* Credentials file: [creds.txt](/files/HackDay2024/creds.txt)
